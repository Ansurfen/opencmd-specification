## What is the OpenCmd Specification?

The **OpenCmd Specification (OCS)** defines a standardized, command-agnostic interface description for command-line tools. It enables both humans and machines to discover and understand the functionality of a command **without needing to execute it**, consult external documentation, or analyze error outputs. When properly described using OpenCmd, a consumer can gain a clear understanding of a command‚Äôs structure, capabilities, and usage.

## Why is this standard necessary?

Command-line interfaces vary significantly across platforms such as Linux and Windows. For instance, **flag syntax differs**:

* On **Linux**, flags are typically prefixed with `-` or `--`
* On **Windows**, flags often use `/`

These inconsistencies can cause confusion and hinder cross-platform tooling. OpenCmd aims to bridge this gap by providing a unified format that abstracts away platform-specific syntax, making command interfaces easier to interpret, document, and integrate.

### Command Identifier

The command identifier is the primary name used to invoke a command-line tool. To ensure compatibility across platforms and tooling systems, the command name must follow a strict but practical naming convention.

‚úÖ **Naming Rules**

* Must begin with an English alphabetic character (`A-Z`, `a-z`)
* May contain:
    * Alphanumeric characters (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`)
    * Hyphens (`-`) as word separators
    * Underscores (`_`) if needed for legacy compatibility
* Should not begin with a digit, symbol, or non-English character

üìå **Examples**

| Identifier | Valid? |	Reason |
| -----| ----- | ----- |
| 1Hello | ‚ùå | Begins with a digit |
| ‰Ω†Â•Ω-world | ‚ùå | Begins with non-English characters |
| Say-Hello | ‚úî | Valid: English word, uses - |
| My_Echo2 | ‚úî | Valid: uses underscore and numbers |
| echo-world |	‚úî |	Common lowercase format with - |
| _start | ‚ùå | Begins with underscore |

üîç **Best Practices**
* Prefer **lowercase** for consistency (`say-hello`, `my-echo`)
* Use `-` to separate words for readability (`generate-report`, `convert-pdf`)
* Avoid names that conflict with reserved system commands (`cd`, `ls`, `dir`, etc.)

## Handling Duplicate Command Names

In some cases, multiple vendors may define commands with the same identifier (e.g., `git`) but different implementations, behaviors, or purposes. To support coexistence and precise resolution, the OpenCmd Specification defines the following disambiguation mechanism.

‚úÖ **Disambiguation Strategies**

Every command should have a globally unique identifier formed as:

**1. Fully Qualified Name (FQN)**
```sh
<vendor>::<name>[@<version>]
```

Examples:

* `git-scm::git@2.44.0` ‚Äì Official Git
* `acme-tools::git@1.0.0` ‚Äì Vendor-customized Git-like tool

This ensures commands with the same visible name are distinguishable by tooling and users.

**2. Metadata Field: `vendor`**

In YAML or JSON schema, always include a field to declare the origin of the command.

```yaml
name: git
version: 2.44.0
vendor: git-scm
```
